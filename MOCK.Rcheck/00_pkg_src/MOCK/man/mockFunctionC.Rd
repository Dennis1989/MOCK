\title{Objective MOCK function calculating the deviation and connectivity of a given
genetic representation of a solution.}
\usage{
mockFunctionC(data, geneOrClusterVector, lNN, decoded)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{NumericMatrix containing the whole dataset.}

\item{geneOrClusterVector}{IntegerVector containing either the genetic representation of edges
or the assignment of points to clusters.}

\item{lNN}{IntegerMatrix containing the L nearest neighbors.}

\item{decoded}{boolean indicating whether \code{geneOrClusterVector} is already decoded. True if
\code{geneOrClusterVector} contains assignment of clusters to points, false if \code{geneOrClusterVector}
is genetic representation of edges.}
}
\value{
List consisting of the overall deviation and connectivity of the genes.
}
\description{

genetic representation of a solution.
