MOCK-package            What the package does (short line)
NSGA2MOCK               NSGA2 implementation for MOCK algorithm.
binSearchC              Find an integer in an ordered vector using
                        binary search.
connectivity            Calculate connectivity measure for a cluster
                        and a corresponding neighborhood matrix.
decodeC                 Decode the genetic representation of the edge
                        assignment.
deviationC              Calculate the deviation within a matrix. This
                        is defined as the sum of deviations of each
                        point from the center vector of the matrix.
euclideanDistanceC      Rcpp implementation of euclidean distance
                        between two vectors.
getNeighborhoodMutationMatrix
                        Calculates a neighborhood-matrix (square, but
                        not symmetric) that contains likelihood for an
                        edge (from row to column) to be mutated in PESA
getNeighborhoodMutationMatrixC
                        Zero-based Rcpp implementation of 'which' for
                        integer vectors.
meanVectorOfMatrixC     Calculate the mean vector for a matrix by
                        computing the mean for each column. This is an
                        alternative to apply(m,2,mean).
midpoint                Calculate the (floor) mid of two integers.
mockFunctionC           Objective MOCK function calculating the
                        deviation and connectivity of a given genetic
                        representation of a solution.
mutateC                 Mutation of individuals in nearest neighbour
                        space
printClusterSolution    printClusterSolution
printParetoFront        PrintCurrentSolutions
rcpp_hello_world        Simple function using Rcpp
resizeList              Resize an integervector to a given size.
resizeVector            Resize an integervector to a given size.
selectRowsOfDatasetC    Select rows of a matrix based on a (one-based)
                        index-vector.
selectRowsOfDatasetCInteger
                        Select rows of a matrix based on a vector.
whichC                  Zero-based Rcpp implementation of 'which' for
                        integer vectors.
whichCList              Zero-based Rcpp implementation of 'which' for
                        integer vectors.
